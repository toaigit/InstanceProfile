There are two json file - AssumeRolePolicy.json  ROnlyS3Policy.json. The ROnlyS3Policy
file contains the list of S3 privileges the instance can do.  Modify this file if needed.

The following policy will be needed to manage the Instance Profile.  You need
to create This policy and grant this policy to the AWS User who are going to
create this IAMInstanceProfile.

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateInstanceProfile",
                "iam:DeleteInstanceProfile",
                "iam:RemoveRoleFromInstanceProfile",
                "iam:DetachRolePolicy",
                "iam:ListInstanceProfiles",
                "iam:DeletePolicyVersion",
                "iam:CreatePolicy",
                "iam:DeletePolicy",
                "iam:DeleteRole",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "iam:DetachUserPolicy",
                "iam:TagRole",
                "ec2:AssociateIamInstanceProfile",
                "ec2:DisassociateIamInstanceProfile",
                "ec2:DescribeIamInstanceProfileAssociations",
                "iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile",
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

MORE EXAMPLE WITH MORE RESTRICT TO PASSROLE:
For example, you might attach the following policy to a user. It gives the user full EC2 permissions, which includes the ability to launch instances.

{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [{
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":["ec2:*"],
      "Resource":"*"
    },
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":"iam:PassRole",
      "Resource":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access"
    }]
}
Notice that the second statement is for the PassRole action, and that the Resource element specifies the ARN of a role named S3Access. When the user launches an EC2 instance, that user is allowed to associate only the S3Access role with the instance. When an application is running in the instances that are launched by this user, that application can perform only the actions that are permitted by whatever is defined in the S3Access role.
